| Fully decentralized | No single actor required; survives operator and team churn |
| Cryptographic finality | Economic and social finality grounded in Bitcoin’s ordering and settlement |
| Execution enforced/validated/proven on Bitcoin | Execution off-chain; Bitcoin provides ordering, value anchoring, settlement references |
| Bitcoin smart contracts | Execution outside Bitcoin, anchored economically to Bitcoin |
| Rollup | Deterministic execution lanes coordinated through markets |
| Sidechain | Execution surfaces that reference Bitcoin without custodial escrows |
| Layer 2 (conventional sense) | Bitcoin-anchored execution infrastructure |
| Inherits Bitcoin’s security wholesale | Bitcoin provides the economic base; legitimacy is earned through usage |
| “Settle application state back to Bitcoin” | Anchors economic truth, value movements, burns, and references to Bitcoin |
| No new chain you must believe in (absolute) | No sovereign chain whose correctness you are required to accept |
| Censorship resistant (absolute) | No single actor can unilaterally censor or shut the system down |

| laneBTC is equivalent to BTC | Bitcoin-denominated working capital for applications |
| laneBTC risk free / parity guaranteed | Parity maintained through open market activity |

| Finished / complete / final system | A constrained core with expanding execution surfaces |
| Replacement for existing Bitcoin infrastructure | Useful when existing approaches break down |

| Everyone should build on LaneLayer | Use LaneLayer when you need unfakeable value, unchangeable rules, non-custodial settlement, or Bitcoin-denominated working capital |

## One-sentence remembered line (playbook)

- “LaneLayer lets developers build real applications that pay with Bitcoin, run like cloud apps, and anchor directly to Bitcoin — no bridges, no new chain religion.”
- “Built for real use cases, not hype.”
